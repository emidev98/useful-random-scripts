# Useful (most of the times) random scripts

Is a collection of scripts that automatize random things which I was lazy to do manually:

- supply-at-height: search for a specific supply at a specific height using Cosmos API iterating block by block.
- top-validators-multi-send: get the 130 top validators and transfer 1UST to each.
- snapshot-mirror-protocol.js: retrieve the native collateral owners with the amount and store the data inside ./data/[address].json,
- update-admin: uses terra.js to update a contract admin
